  This filter is based on this paper:
Chao Chuan Jia, Chuan Jiang Wang, Ting Yang, Bing Hui Fan, Fu Gui He,
A 3D Point Cloud Filtering Algorithm based on Surface Variation Factor Classification,
Procedia Computer Science, 2019
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050919307793

The summary is:

Suppose a point cloud representing a scan of a surface.
Given the covariance matrix of a subset of the point cloud
(the knn of a point for example), the eigenvectors of this matrix are
the principal axes of the subset and represents its overall orienation. The principal axis
associated with the smallest eigenvalue gives an approximation of
the normal of the surface. For a perfectly flat surface, the smallest eigenvalue
 will be zero and the associated eigenvector may be ill defined (singular).

In order to approximate the surface variation, one can use

sigma = lambda_0 / (lambda_0 + lambda_1 + lambda_2)

where lambda_0 is defined as the smallest eigenvalue.

The number of knn used to evaluate the eigenvalues will have an impact on the result, choose this value carefully.
